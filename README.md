Mangroves & Globalization Graduate Pursuit
# Summary
Our SESYNC Graduate Pursuit will investigate how public engagement with biodiversity and international trade influence the success of conservation. 

Mangrove socio-environmental systems are well-suited for examination of how public engagement relates to tradeoffs between demand for aquaculture products and environmental protection at national scales.
